                <h3>iPhones</h3>
                <h4>$15 per Transfer</h4>
                
                iPhones use Apple's data securing software and hardware to insure the best in class experience when it comes to software privacy and support.
                This however can make our job more difficult if you do not know your password. Make sure to always backup any new or old password after a transfer has been completed.
                iPhones specifically can be left at the store for data transfer and can be picked up the same day.

                <h3>iPads</h3>
                <h4>$15 per transfer</h4>
                iPads use Apple's data securing software and hardware to insure the best in class experience when it comes to software privacy and support.
                This however can make our job more difficult if you do not know your password. Make sure to always backup any new or old password after a transfer has been completed.
                iPads have a longer waiting period depending on the class of device and the storage capacity as the newer Pro models use the USB-C standard which implements a faster transfer rate.

                <h4>$100 per Transfer</h4>
                
                Desktops are a bit more trickey depending on the manufacturer. Apple devices are nearly impossibel to transfer data off of unless you have the deviecs password. If you do not have the password
                please take your business to Apple as we cannot help you. Otherwise if you have a windows machine we can easily take care fo you as long as your machine does not have bitlocker enabled
                and if it does have bitlocker enabled we will need you to give us the key for encryption before we can begin work.

                <h3>Android Phones and Tablets</h3>
                <h4>$15 per Transfer</h4>
                
                Android devices can be as easy for data transfers as Apple devices, if not easier as they usuially have an unlocked bootloader allowing us to access the files esaily and transfer them without issue to another device
                or a new phone if you want us to do so.
